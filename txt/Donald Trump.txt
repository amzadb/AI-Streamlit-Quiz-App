Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who has served as the 47th president of the United States since January 20, 2025. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.

Born in New York City, Trump graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He became president of his family real estate business in 1971, and oriented it to luxury accommodation. After a series of business bankruptcies in the 1990s, he launched several side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted and co-produced the reality television series The Apprentice. In 2015, Trump began his successful 2016 campaign for the presidency.

During his first term, Trump's immigration policy included a travel ban targeting refugees and nationals of certain Muslim-majority countries, and expanding the U.S.â€“Mexico border wall; he also briefly implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back many environmental policies, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, began a trade war with China in 2018, successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, and withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program. Trump became the first sitting president to enter North Korea, but did not reach an agreement on denuclearization with Kim Jong Un. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump downplayed its severity, contradicted guidance from health officials, and signed the CARES Act stimulus. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked Trump one of the worst presidents in American history.
